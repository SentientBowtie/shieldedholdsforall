~~a very simple mod by SOLDIER First~~

Shielded Holds For All does one thing - it enables the modspec for Shielded Cargo Holds, the ever so rare built-in-only hullmod that makes cargo scans less likely to discover any contraband you may be carrying.
No longer are you forced to retain a Hound, Cerberus, Mule (P), Buffalo (P), or one of various mod-added ships in your fleet in order to keep your drugs and AI Cores from the prying hands of the Hegemony.
Now, all you have to do is acquire the Shielded Cargo Holds modspec, and you can add the smuggler's closest friend to any ship you like!

The Shielded Cargo Holds modspec costs 7500 credits and is available for purchase or discovery anywhere other modspecs can be found. Try asking around at less-than-legal markets.
The hullmod is now a logistics hullmod, so you'll have to choose wisely what you install alongside it when outfitting logistics ships. Or you can use some of that good old spacer ingenuity to build it into the hull yourself...
Installing the modified equipment into a hold that doesn't really need it is difficult work. OP costs for the hullmod are 8/16/24/40 points, a little higher than other logistics hullmods.
The process must also be performed while docked at a shipyard, since the equipment has to be installed everywhere inside the holds to function properly.

Of course, you're not the first spacer to make use of this hullmod. There's talk around that independents, pirates, the Luddic Path, and even miscreants of the Persean League can be seen with this equipment in their ships.
Not to mention some lesser-known polities hanging around the fringes of the Sector, including...

-the Rimward Venture Trading Company
-Hazard Mining Incorporated
-the Mayasuran Navy
-the Roiders Union
-the Persean Democratic People's Revolutionary Council
-the Stormhawk Republic
-the Reavers of Ludd
-the Legio Infernalis

...and potentially other factions, but that remains to be seen.

Shielded Holds For All should be compatible with pretty much any mod. As long as you don't install something else that modifies the Shielded Cargo Holds entry in hullmods.csv or ShieldedCargoHolds.jar, you should be good to go.
Feel free to change any part of the mod you like - give the hullmod to every faction, set the price to be dirt cheap, or make it rarer than a trio of tachyon lances. It's up to you!
Perhaps in the future I'll be able to give this mod a proper settings file that handles everything for you automatically. I've got a lot of learning to do before that, though.

Let me know in the official Starsector Discord if there are any problems and we can sit around scratching our heads trying to figure out what's causing them. My tag is SOLDIER First#5045.

Special thanks to Timid, Yunru, and ruddygreat in the Discord for help with figuring out how to make this very simple mod.
